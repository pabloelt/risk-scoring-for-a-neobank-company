## Introduction

The client for this project is a neobank specializing in offering competitively priced loans. However, the company is concerned about the quality of borrowers accessing their products. They require a robust system to assist in making informed loan approval decisions based on applicants‚Äô profiles.

The goal is to implement a risk-scoring model using artificial intelligence algorithms to identify ‚Äòrisky‚Äô applicants and estimate their associated expected losses. This information will be used to manage the bank‚Äôs economic capital, portfolio, and risk assessment effectively.

## Objectives

The main objective is to develop a risk-scoring model using machine learning algorithms to predict potentially risky borrowers. This model will estimate the expected financial loss for each new customer-loan pairing, based on the company‚Äôs historical data. By leveraging this advanced analytical tool, the company‚Äôs performance will be significantly enhanced.

## Project results

### Recommended actions from EDA

Several insights have been uncovered through the exploratory data analysis. The main actionable initiatives are summarized below.

1. Credit scores appear to be effective in identifying high-quality borrowers. These profiles should be targeted for promotion, and a broader range of products, such as investment opportunities, stocks, and index funds, could be offered to them.

2. The job title category needs improvement to provide more accurate information, which will be beneficial for the development of the machine learning algorithms.

3. Since three main borrower profiles have been identified based on credit card usage, targeted campaigns can be developed for each group. Customized products or loans tailored to their specific needs could be offered to them.

4. According to the company‚Äôs historical data, 30-month loans are performing better. These should be promoted, and additional products in this category could be considered.


### Risk scoring model

In this project, we have developed a risk-scoring model to predict the Expected Loss (EL) associated with a new loan application. To achieve that, three key risk parameters are considered:

* **Probability of Default (PD):** This measures the likelihood that a borrower will default, based on an internally assigned credit rating.
* **Exposure at Default (EAD):** This indicates the amount of outstanding debt at the time of default.
* **Loss Given Default (LGD):** This metric represents the percentage of the loan exposure that is not expected to be recovered if a default occurs.

To estimate these risk parameters, three predictive machine learning models are developed. For the PD model, a logistic regression algorithm is used since high interpretability and auditability are required at this stage in the financial sector. On the other hand, for estimating the EAD and LGD models LightGBM algorithms are finally selected due to their superior performance. The predictions from these models are then combined to calculate the EL for each loan transaction. To calculate this value, the following formula is applied:

$$
EL[\textdollar] = PD \cdot P[\textdollar] \cdot EAD \cdot LDG,
$$

where P is the loan principal, i.e., the amount of money the borrower whises to apply for.

### Risk scoring analyzer web app

To maximize the value of the developed machine learning models, it is essential to seamlessly deploy them into production so that employees can start utilizing them to make informed, practical decisions.

To achieve this, a prototype web application has been designed. This web app gathers internal data from the company for each client, as well as information provided by the borrower through their loan application.

## Instructions

The project should be run using the same environment in which it was created.

* Project environment can be replicated using the <mark>riesgos.yml</mark> file, which was created during the set up phase of the project. It can be found in the folder <mark>01_Documentos</mark>.
* To replicate the environment it is necessary to copy the <mark>riesgos.yml</mark> file to the directory and use the terminal or anaconda prompt executing:
  * conda env create --file riesgos.yml --name project_name

On the other hand, remember to update the project_path variable of the notebooks to the path where you have replicated the project.
